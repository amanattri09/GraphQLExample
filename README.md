# GraphQLExample
This is very simple example of consuming a open source GraphQL query. <BR>
  
-We have many free open source GraphQl sever to learn it <BR>
-I used "https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql" in this project <BR>
-Refrence for other free open source Graphql api : https://www.apollographql.com/blog/community/backend/8-free-to-use-graphql-apis-for-your-projects-and-demos/ <BR>
-I followed CLEAN ARCHETECTURE in this project <BR>

We will need to download schema.json file from GraphQl server.You can follow this video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsXjtQJLrxE" to do that <br>
